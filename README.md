Utilising the following:

## Questions

### Question 1
Tools I use:
- VS Code
- Github
- Laravel Valet (for local development enviroments)
- Laravel Mix (webpack wrapper bult by Jeffrey Way)
- Stack overflow is always a good resource if you are stuck on a specific issue
- Docs of the framework in use (if any)
- CSS Tricks is a great resource for Frontend help
- Codepen (an easy place to thrash out an idea before committing to code)

### Question 2
Having been Head of Digital in one of my previous roles I was always involved in the whole process of designing and building elements. I would sit with the designers and work through their ideas, making sure they were achievable when going to code. One particular part of a project I am proud of is creating a large calendar of events with very little design or client input. It took a lot of tinkering and researching to get some nice ideas to go forwards with.
